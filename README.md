The MERN stack web application, without the "E" (Express.js), used Next.js for API calls instead.

# Getting Started

You can `git clone` this project by using,

```git
git clone https://github.com/Jasper0077
```

After that, you can install the dependencies

```node
npm i
```

You might need to setup your own Mongodb database either locally or via Cloud, provided the `.env.example` file for reference if you plan to use remote database on MongoDB Cloud.

Lastly, you can run in `localhost` with

```node
npm run dev
```
